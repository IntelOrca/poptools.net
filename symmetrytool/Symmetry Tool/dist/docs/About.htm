<h1>About Populous Symmetry Tool</h1>
<p>Welcome to the Populous Symmetry Tool, which can help level designers with the chore of making levels fair, with equal wood, land, height, huts, wildmen etc. It works by creating a mirror image of one half of the map, or mirror image in two directions of one quarter of the map. Both land and objects can be mirrored, and in the case of objects specific to one tribe, they can be modified in colour to create the same number of objects for each tribe. Other features include rotatation and movement of the map.</p>

<p>This Symmetry Tool is a fresh remake of the original Symmetry Tool made a few years back. Version 2.0 now uses .Net Framework and is more up to date with the current operating systems. Version 1.5 can still be downloaded via it's <a href="http://www.tedtycoon.co.uk/populous/">Official Site</a>.</p>

<p>For more information visit the <a href="http://www.tedtycoon.co.uk/populous/">Official Site</a> where more of TedTycoon's programs can be found.</p>
